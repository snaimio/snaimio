✅ **Polish Highlights:**

1. Reworded sections for **clarity & flow** (e.g., “About Me” vs. “The Profile”).
2. Unified tense and phrasing to feel professional and recruiter-friendly.
3. Minor emoji tweaks to make them **meaningful & readable**.
4. Improved readability for **GitHub visitors scanning quickly**.

If you want, I can also **design a “super condensed, ultra-punchy header version”** of this README that fits in **one scrollable glance**—perfect for recruiters to see your AI + Web skills immediately.

Do you want me to do that?
