## 🧑‍💻 About Me

**AI-Integrated Mobile Web Developer | Building, Learning, Delivering**

I am an AI-Integrated Mobile Web Developer and creative technologist at triOS College (Class of 2027), where I am focused on engineering production-ready applications that merge high-fidelity design with intelligent functionality. My expertise lies in transforming complex design systems into smooth, real-world digital experiences using a technical stack that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By prioritizing solid logic and research-driven user flows—guided by Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design—I deliver clean UI supported by purposeful AI integration. I am currently developing AI-driven dashboards and high-fidelity prototypes, with a professional goal of securing an internship to apply my skills in full-stack development and AI orchestration.

**Current Projects:** Developing high-fidelity prototypes like "GreenThumb Community Gardens" in Figma and implementing AI-driven dashboards.

**Core Philosophy:** Prioritizing native-feeling web solutions and research-backed design systems.

**Graduation Goal:** April 2027 (Looking for Internship Opportunities).
